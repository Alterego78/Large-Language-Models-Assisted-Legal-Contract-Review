# Large-Language-Models-Assisted-Legal-Contract-Review

This is a Github repository for my Honour's thesis project #Large Language Models Assisted Legal Contract Review at the University of Sydney. This is an individual research supervised by Dr. Ying Zhou, concluded with a formal thesis and presentation by the University.

The project was conducted from Aug 2022 to Jul 2023, at an early stage of LLMs like GPT 3 & 3.5. The research was limited on some aspects due to the technical issue of the LLMs back then, but previous experience were gained from working with LLMs and solving real life problems.

This repository contains the work of my thesis and a PDF version of the final presentation.
