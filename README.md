# Large-Language-Models-Assisted-Legal-Contract-Review

This is a Github Repository for my Honour's thesis project Large Language Models Assisted Legal Contract Review at the University of Sydney.

The project was conducted from Aug 2022 to Jul 2023, at an early stage of LLMs like GPT 3 & 3.5. The research was limited on some aspects due to the technical issue of the LLMs back then, but I still had previous experience on working with LLMs.
